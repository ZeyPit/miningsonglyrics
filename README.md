# Mining Song Lyrics from Genius
Ulitizing the ```lyricsgenius``` package to create lyrics corpora from Genius. 
The package, along with example usage, can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius). 
My code implements the package and creates a csv file
with basic information about the top 10 songs from Rihanna and Justin Timberlake (e.g. album title, year of release), along with their lyrics.

This code is meant to be used for Natural Language Processing projects (e.g. song genre classification, song lyrics analysis).
Feel free to modify the code as you please.

Code explained in my blog post, [Mining Song Lyrics from Genius](https://zpitenis.com/blog/post/mining-song-lyrics-from-genius/).
